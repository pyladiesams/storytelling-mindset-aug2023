# Storytelling Mindset: Transforming Tech Careers By Crafting Powerful Connections

## Workshop description
A big misconception about succeeding in Tech is that the smartest person gets the furthest. In reality, getting far is less about competition and more about building connections.

A great story allows people to connect to great ideas, which makes storytelling one of the most effective tools in your professional toolbox.

From acing interviews and building an authentic personal brand to practicing true leadership and building successful teams, join this interactive workshop to learn what makes a good story and how getting better at storytelling can help you advance your career in tech.

Your perspective matters: bring your own stories and letâ€™s discuss how the power of a good story can help accelerate your career in Tech.
